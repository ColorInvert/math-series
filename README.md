Tests

  Tests are run using pytest, and pytest-watch.
    
  Tests exist for each of the three functions. Input values 0, 3, 5, and 7 are tested for the fibonacci and lucas numbers, alongside tests to ensure the functions exist at all.
  sum_series has an existence test, a test for no input optional values with the mandatory value as 0, 1, 2, and 7, as well as tests for inputting optional values to make sum_series behave identically to the Lucas series (0, 1, 2, and 7.)


  No tests were performed however for the intermediate numbers that are unmentioned above, and no tests were performed for other optional inputs of sum_series, only a simulation of using sum_series to duplicate the behavior of the Lucas series was tested.
